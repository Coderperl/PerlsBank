# PerlsBank
Full stack application of a fictional bank. 

My most advanced aplication to date. A bank administration system, where cashiers, and admin users can use "Bank" functionality, built in crud functionality.
Admin and cashiers are roles that are authorized to actually use the functionality.

Cashier functionality: 
-Ability to see all registered customers.
-Ability to enter an Id in input, and instantly being transfered to that customers profile.
-Ability to search by name and city.
-Ability to sort customers via header.
-Making transactions of type deposit, withdrawal, and transfer.
-See all the accounts of selected customer, and all the transactions made to, and from selected account. 
-Adding new customers whith built in algorithm to automatically generate accounts with some transactions.
-Editing customers, changing the customers personal information.

Admin functionality:
-Is authorized to do the same actions as cashier, but has ability to administer users.
-Ability to see all registered users.
-Ability to create new users, and assign them roles.
-Ability to edit users, (username, Email, Password, Role).
